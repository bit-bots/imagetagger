# imagetagger

This is a collaborative online tool for labeling image data.

If you are participating in RoboCup, you should not install your own instance but rather use the one provided by the Hamburg Bit-Bots (https://imagetagger.bit-bots.de). This enables you to use already labeled images from other teams and to share your own.

For a short overview of the functions please have a look at the following poster: https://robocup.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/imagetagger-poster.pdf
