# imagetagger

This is a collaborative online tool for labeling image data.

If you are participating in RoboCup, you should not install your own instance but rather use the one provided by the Hamburg Bit-Bots (https://imagetagger.bit-bots.de). This enables you to use already labeled images from other teams and to share your own.
